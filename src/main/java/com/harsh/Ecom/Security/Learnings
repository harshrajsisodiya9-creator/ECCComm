In auth service we could have just used lookup from databse using User user = userRepo.getByUsername(username)

but instead we first we authenticate it using authenticationManager(fill it with the provided username and password)
then loads the user from the database(via UserDetailsService(custom made ny me also provided by the spring security module))
then hashes the provided password compares it with the stored hash in password database
verifies the account state(locked,enabled,expired)
applies the respective security policies
throws an exception if anything is wrong

Note: Authentication Is a Policy Engine, Not a Lookup

if all checks are passed we get authentication.authenticated() == true
