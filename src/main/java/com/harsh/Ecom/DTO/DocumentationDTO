So im gonna have both model mapper and mapstruct implementation in here
modelMapper was done using @Configuration and @Bean annotations so that mapping of the fields from product could be done(i.e different field names for same data)
modelMapper does the entity to DTO conversion during runtime(runtime errors may occur), so its better to use mapStruct
First half of the ProdService is used by modelMapper to for conversion and returning of ProdDto

Second half of the ProdService which is done for updating, adding and deleting of products on the database is done with mapStruct
Mapstruct is done by providing an Interface which spring automatically produces class of during compile time(ProductMapper(interface) class(ProductMapperImpl) (class made by compiler))
Compile Time safety is provided by MapStruct as it gives error(if exist) on compile time only
