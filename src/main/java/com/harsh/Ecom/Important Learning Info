Controller and Service files regarding the fetching and adding to database of an image

we use @RequestPart (two parts here in the case of pure data(text,numbers,boolean) and image(binary data))
to divide the data into multiple parts to store, cause JSON can't store binary data efficiently
it will use Base64 to encode the data to text and which will make it 30-40% more larger plus more
CPU load.

So we take the data into two parts(More clean code too)

about the IOException error part in getBytes from the binary data of ImageFile

so the thing is why I/O it's not like its reading a disk file directly, its till I/O
it's reading the file stream from memory or temporary storage that spring uses to hold uploaded files
and I/O operations are not guaranteed to succeed
they can fail for many reasons like:
Upload interruption mid-way
file too large, server blocked it due to limit size
temporary file before getBytes(),corrupted stream(bad data uploaded)

now why not use a try and catch error in service because we are supposed to handle that in the controller
why    because the controller layer is responsible for HTTP response service layer focuses on business logic

throws IOException is written with addProduct as signature this means if an IOException were to occur
then don't handle it just throw it up to the caller and the caller is in controller
